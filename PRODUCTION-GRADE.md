  build_and_deploy_to_gcp:
    timeout-minutes: 60  # Prevents runaway jobs
    steps:
      # Security first approach
      - name: Security Validation and Pre-flight Checks
        uses: ./.github/actions/security-validation
        with:
          enable_security_scan: ${{ inputs.environment_name == 'prod' && 'true' || 'false' }}
          max_severity_allowed: ${{ inputs.environment_name == 'prod' && 'MEDIUM' || 'HIGH' }}

      # Resilient operations with retry logic
