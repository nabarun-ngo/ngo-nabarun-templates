# GCP Restart App Engine Action

A composite action to restart Google App Engine service by deleting all existing instances to force recreation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

**This action will DELETE ALL RUNNING INSTANCES** for the specified App Engine service. This will cause temporary service downtime until new instances are automatically created when traffic arrives.

**Use with extreme caution in production environments!**

## Overview

This action provides a controlled way to restart App Engine services by deleting all existing instances. This is useful for:
- Forcing a fresh restart of the application
- Clearing memory leaks or stuck processes
- Applying configuration changes that require a restart
- Troubleshooting service issues

## Features

- üî• **Instance Deletion**: Deletes all running instances for specified service/version
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Confirmation**: Requires explicit confirmation to prevent accidents
- üîÑ **Dry Run Mode**: Test the operation without making actual changes
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Service Recovery**: Monitors service status after restart
- üìä **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive metrics and status reporting
- üéØ **Version Targeting**: Can target specific versions or all versions
- ‚ö° **Auto-Recovery**: Instances are automatically recreated by App Engine

## Usage

### Basic Usage (with required confirmation)

```yaml
- name: Restart App Engine service
  uses: nabarun-ngo/ngo-nabarun-templates/.github/actions/gcp-restart-app-engine@main
  with:
    project_id: 'my-gcp-project'
    service_name: 'default'
    confirm_restart: 'yes'  # Required for safety
```

### Dry Run (recommended first step)

```yaml
- name: Test App Engine restart (dry run)
  uses: nabarun-ngo/ngo-nabarun-templates/.github/actions/gcp-restart-app-engine@main
  with:
    project_id: 'my-gcp-project'
    service_name: 'api-service'
    confirm_restart: 'yes'
    dry_run: 'true'  # No actual changes
```

### Advanced Usage (specific version)

```yaml
- name: Restart specific App Engine version
  uses: nabarun-ngo/ngo-nabarun-templates/.github/actions/gcp-restart-app-engine@main
  with:
    project_id: 'my-gcp-project'
    service_name: 'api-service'
    version_id: 'v20240115-123456'
    confirm_restart: 'yes'
    wait_timeout: '600'  # Wait up to 10 minutes
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `project_id` | GCP Project ID where the service is deployed | ‚úÖ Yes | - |
| `service_name` | Name of the App Engine service to restart | ‚ùå No | `default` |
| `version_id` | Specific version ID to restart (empty = all versions) | ‚ùå No | - |
| `confirm_restart` | **Must be "yes" to execute** | ‚úÖ Yes | - |
| `dry_run` | Perform dry run without actual changes | ‚ùå No | `false` |
| `wait_timeout` | Wait timeout for instance recreation (seconds) | ‚ùå No | `300` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `restart_result` | Result message of the restart operation |
| `instances_deleted` | Number of instances that were deleted |
| `instances_recreated` | Number of instances recreated after restart |
| `execution_time` | Total time taken for the operation |
| `service_status` | Final status of the service after restart |

## Safety Features

### 1. Confirmation Requirement
The action **will not proceed** unless `confirm_restart` is set to `"yes"`. This prevents accidental execution.

```yaml
# ‚ùå This will fail
confirm_restart: 'no'    # Default value

# ‚úÖ This will proceed  
confirm_restart: 'yes'   # Required for execution
```

### 2. Dry Run Mode
Always test with dry run first to see what would be affected:

```yaml
dry_run: 'true'  # Shows what would be done without doing it
```

### 3. Input Validation
The action validates all inputs and provides clear error messages for issues.

## How It Works

1. **Validation**: Checks inputs, GCP authentication, and service existence
2. **Discovery**: Lists current instances for the specified service/version
3. **Deletion**: Deletes all found instances (if not dry run)
4. **Recovery Wait**: Waits for service stabilization
5. **Verification**: Checks final service status and new instances

## Behavior with Different Scenarios

### When Instances Exist
```
üî• Found 3 instances - deleting all
‚úÖ Deleted 3 instances successfully
‚è≥ Waiting for service recovery...
üìä 0 instances now running (normal - will be created on demand)
```

### When No Instances Running
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è No instances currently running
üîÑ Triggering service refresh instead...
‚úÖ Service refresh completed
```

### Dry Run Mode
```
üîÑ [DRY RUN] Would delete the following instances:
   - instance-1 (v20240115-123456)
   - instance-2 (v20240115-123456)
‚úÖ [DRY RUN] Would have deleted 2 instances
```

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) must be installed and configured
- Proper GCP authentication (service account or user credentials)
- Required GCP permissions:
  - `appengine.instances.list`
  - `appengine.instances.delete`
  - `appengine.services.get`
  - `appengine.services.update`

## Use Cases

### 1. Memory Leak Resolution
```yaml
# When your service has memory leaks and needs a fresh start
- uses: nabarun-ngo/ngo-nabarun-templates/.github/actions/gcp-restart-app-engine@main
  with:
    project_id: ${{ vars.GCP_PROJECT }}
    service_name: 'api-service'
    confirm_restart: 'yes'
```

### 2. Configuration Changes
```yaml
# After deploying config changes that require restart
- uses: nabarun-ngo/ngo-nabarun-templates/.github/actions/gcp-restart-app-engine@main
  with:
    project_id: ${{ vars.GCP_PROJECT }}
    service_name: 'web-service'
    confirm_restart: 'yes'
```

### 3. Troubleshooting
```yaml
# When service is unresponsive and needs forced restart
- uses: nabarun-ngo/ngo-nabarun-templates/.github/actions/gcp-restart-app-engine@main
  with:
    project_id: ${{ vars.GCP_PROJECT }}
    service_name: 'worker-service'
    confirm_restart: 'yes'
    wait_timeout: '600'  # Give more time for complex services
```

## Integration with Workflows

This action is designed to work with the GCP-Ops workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  emergency-restart:
    name: 'Emergency Service Restart'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production  # Requires environment approval
    steps:
      - name: Authenticate with GCP
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
      
      - name: Setup gcloud
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2
      
      - name: Restart service instances
        id: restart
        uses: nabarun-ngo/ngo-nabarun-templates/.github/actions/gcp-restart-app-engine@main
        with:
          project_id: ${{ vars.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          service_name: ${{ inputs.service_name }}
          confirm_restart: 'yes'
      
      - name: Notify team
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "Service restart completed: ${{ steps.restart.outputs.restart_result }}"
          # Add your notification logic here (Slack, email, etc.)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Use Dry Run First**: Test the operation before executing
2. **Monitor After Restart**: Watch service health and traffic handling
3. **Use Environment Protection**: Require approvals for production restarts
4. **Plan for Downtime**: Understand there will be temporary service unavailability
5. **Have Rollback Plan**: Know how to handle issues if they arise
6. **Document Restarts**: Log reasons and results for troubleshooting

## Error Handling

The action includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing confirmation
- Invalid service names or versions
- GCP authentication issues
- Instance deletion failures
- Service verification problems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Restart not confirmed" Error**
   ```
   ‚ùå Restart not confirmed. Set confirm_restart to 'yes' to proceed.
   ```
   **Solution**: Set `confirm_restart: 'yes'`

2. **Service Not Found**
   ```
   ‚ùå Service 'my-service' not found in project 'my-project'
   ```
   **Solution**: Verify service name and project ID

3. **Permission Denied**
   ```
   ‚ùå Failed to delete instances
   ```
   **Solution**: Check GCP service account permissions

4. **Instances Not Recreated**
   ```
   üìä Current instances after restart: 0
   ```
   **Note**: This is normal! Instances are created on-demand when traffic arrives.
